# Norwegian-Mouseover-Dictionary
A Norwegian to English Mouseover Dictionary Chromium Extension.
I just made this to help myself learn Norweigan and figured I'd put it up so others can use it as well.

## Features

- **Mouseover Dictionary:** Hover over any Norwegian word on a webpage to see its translation.
- **Multiple Dictionaries:** Displays both Bokmål and Nynorsk translations.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** The extension has a light and dark mode that will adapt depending on what you are currently using.
- **Toggle On/Off:** Easily enable or disable the functionality via the extension popup.

## Known Bugs
- When loading a new page the toggle will need to be turned on and off again to disable the functionality.

## What I'd like to add in the future 

- More dictionaries
- Grammar concepts so the program isn't searching for an exact match
- A Safari version of the extension
- Some type of integration with Anki
- Improved UI
